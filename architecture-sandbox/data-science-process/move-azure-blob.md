# Move data to and from Azure Blob storage

The Team Data Science Process requires that data be ingested or loaded into a variety of different storage environments to be processed or analyzed in the most appropriate way in each stage of the process.

## Different technologies for moving data

The following articles describe how to move data to and from Azure Blob storage using different technologies.

* [Azure Storage-Explorer](move-data-to-azure-blob-using-azure-storage-explorer.md)
* [AzCopy](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10)
* [Python](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python)
* [SSIS](move-data-to-azure-blob-using-ssis.md)

Which method is best for you depends on your scenario. The [Scenarios for advanced analytics in Azure Machine Learning](plan-sample-scenarios.md) article helps you determine the resources you need for a variety of data science workflows used in the advanced analytics process.

> [!NOTE]
> For a complete introduction to Azure blob storage, refer to [Azure Blob Basics](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet) and to [Azure Blob Service](/rest/api/storageservices/Blob-Service-Concepts).

## Using Azure Data Factory

As an alternative, you can use [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory/) to: 

* create and schedule a pipeline that downloads data from Azure blob storage, 
* pass it to a published Azure Machine Learning web service, 
* receive the predictive analytics results, and 
* upload the results to storage. 

For more information, see [Create predictive pipelines using Azure Data Factory and Azure Machine Learning](/azure/data-factory/transform-data-using-machine-learning).

## Prerequisites
This article assumes that you have an Azure subscription, a storage account, and the corresponding storage key for that account. Before uploading/downloading data, you must know your Azure Storage account name and account key.

* To set up an Azure subscription, see [Free one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* For instructions on creating a storage account and for getting account and key information, see [About Azure Storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).

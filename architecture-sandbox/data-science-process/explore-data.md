# Explore data in the Team Data Science Process

Exploring data is a step in the [Team Data Science Process](overview.md).

The following articles describe how to explore data in three different storage environments that are typically used in the Data Science Process:

* Explore [Azure blob container](explore-data-blob.md) data using the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Python package.
* Explore [SQL Server](explore-data-sql-server.md) data by using SQL and by using a programming language like Python.
* Explore [Hive table](explore-data-hive-tables.md) data using Hive queries.

In addition, the video, [Preprocessing Data in Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/preprocessing-data-in-azure-ml-studio/), describes the commonly used modules for cleaning and transforming data.

  ## Data Flow

  1. Data scientists train a model using Azure Machine Learning workbench and an HDInsight cluster. The model is containerized and put into an Azure Container Registry.
  1. The model is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Stack.
  1. End users provide data that's scored against the model.

  ## Components

  * [Machine Learning Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning-studio): Easily build, deploy, and manage predictive analytics solutions
  * [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight): Provision cloud Hadoop, Spark, R Server, HBase, and Storm clusters
  * [Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry): Store and manage container images across all types of Azure deployments
